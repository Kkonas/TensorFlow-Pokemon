Pokemon is one of the famous games that use @Tensorflow in playing the entire game. Most
Famous of is the “Pikachu”. There is a whole repo of detecting Pikachu which I did in #GDGNairobi. 
Checkout the repo is you are new to tensorflow. 
Collect Data
 The Pekomen’s data is very much open in Kaggle  as it has one of the best data sets for our model. Go ahead and download the dataset . use https://www.kaggle.com and select the datases we shall be operating from
Installation and libraries 
Let’s set down out libraries and get to know what to install

Once the installation is done, categorize the data from Kaggle into simple training categories of two 
Data sets and neural layers.  Using Keras.
Keras is a good for training using your preferred layers. For our case we will use Keras with 2 layers .
With Rectified Linear Units and Logistic regression, we group the model into two probability testing case
.you can learn more about Keras on https://keras.io/
