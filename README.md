Pokemon is one of the famous games that use

@Tensorflow in playing the entire game. Most

Famous of is the “Pikachu”. There is a whole 

repo of detecting Pikachu which I did in #GDGNairobi. 

Checkout the repo is you are new to tensorflow. 

Collect Data

 The Pekomen’s data is very much open in Kaggle 

 as it has one of the best data sets for our model.

 Go ahead and download the dataset .

 use https://www.kaggle.com and select the 

 datases we shall be operating from

Installation and libraries 

Let’s set down out libraries and get to

know what to install

Once the installation is done, categorize the data

from Kaggle into simple training categories of two 

Data sets and neural layers.  Using Keras.

Keras is a good for training using your preferred layers. 

For our case we will use Keras with 2 layers .

With Rectified Linear Units and Logistic regression,

we group the model into two probability testing case

.you can learn more about

 Keras on https://keras.io/

Training your Model is  the most important part. 

We will train the model and plot the training process 

On the matplotlib to show the Learning rate

Because our model is a supervised machine Learning models, 

We will use SGD Algorithm to perform optimization.

We will choose our

1.	Loss –‘sparse_categorical_crossentropy’
2.	Optimizer-‘sgd’
3.	Epoch –‘400’

Finally after the model trains and get optimized

To an accuracy of 98%, we can now start playing the Game.

Congratulaitons  we are done. Let’s play
